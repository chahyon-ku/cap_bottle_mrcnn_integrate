# mrcnn_integrate

This repo is part of [kPAM](https://github.com/weigao95/kPAM) that provides the data generator and training script for the [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). This repo don't need the `ros` runtime.

Currently, the dataset used in this repo is the same as the multi-view 3D reconstruction dataset in [DenseObjectNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08756). The document for training is under construction. To evaluate a trained network, please take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/weigao95/mankey-ros).
